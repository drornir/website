**IDP** is often used as an abbreviation for both "Internal Develop Platform"
and "Internal Develop Portal". This is confusing since the Portal is one of the
parts of the Platform.

I'll try to give an introductory explanation on what an IDP system is all about,
as it is one of the hyped buzzwords these days around the DevOps circles. 

## Wait, what are you talking about?

So I said the ID Portal is a part of the ID Platform, so I'll start with
explaining what an ID Platform is, and then the Portal part will make sense.

For me, an IDP is a software system that is used by the developers of a tech 
company in order to increase productivity in the organization. In plain terms,
it's like creating a simpler, more robust version of AWS for your own dev team.

Basically it's a solution to a problem many companies tackle once they grow 
to a certain size. You probably started as a small startup, and in a startup 
everything moves fast and there's really no justification to think about 
things like scale, security and modularity. Usually, Roby on Rails, Laravel, 
Spring and similar monolithic frameworks can get you very far with just 
scaling up the CPU and memory vertically.

Yeah, there's a lot to unpack here
