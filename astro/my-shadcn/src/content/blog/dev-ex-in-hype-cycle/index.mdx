I've always believed in Dev Tools. Recently, there was a surge in popularity of
Dev Tools and improving the UX a developer experiences. I got really excited a couple of years
ago when I saw [startups](https://www.upbound.io/) [emerging](https://roadie.io/) in this space.
But recently I hear that this whole field was deemed "too expensive" or "not worth it"
by both potential customers and even investors.

I fundamentally disagree with this sentiment. I agree that _today_ it's too expensive,
but I disagree with **investors** who don't believe in the _future_ and potential of
DevOps tools.

I'd like to explain why I think this recent decline in popularity is actually
very natural, and is **not** a strong enough signal to keep me from working in this field.

# The Hype Cycle

The Gartenr hype cycle is a simplified model to

> "represent the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies".

It's a good model, which we won't dive deep into in this post. However, for those who are unfamiliar with the hype cycle, the idea is that when new tech emrges, it initially
goes up in so much popularity that it becomes a bubble, which collapses but eventually recovers and stabilizes.

This is of course an idealized model, and it is careful not specify how long each step takes.
It also _doesn't specify how high_ are the peaks and _how low_ are the lows.
The "Pleateau of Productivity" (see image above) might end up being very close to zero.
You can see below how they add that dimension of time by coloring the dots on the graph.

You can see an example on [Gratner's Blog](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-s-new-in-artificial-intelligence-from-the-2023-gartner-hype-cycle)
where they try to place different technologies on this curve. This is an example for AI:

I find Gartner's model useful when I'm thinking about the next thing I want to work on.
I want to solve **actual** problems. Duh, right? Who _actively_ wants to work on something useless?
(A lot of people actually. But that's besides the point)

The point is that the most basic human way to figure out if something is real is to simply ask around!

- Hear a sound in the middle of the night? _Wake your partner!_
- Have a hard school assignment? _Ask your friends if it's also hard for them._
- Don't know the capital of Germany? _Google it!_

This usually works, right? Well, usually yes, but the Gartner model suggests there's a caveat.
The model says that it takes time for people to understand what you can and can't do with a certain piece of tech.

Meaning, at scale and on average, it takes time for society to understand the real value of a certain piece of tech.

Well, ok. This is pretty abstract. It's not very concrete on how long this cycle takes and how
to get around this.

But for me, this is a reminder to try to consider multiple data points before ruling out
a potential tech _just because_ it's _current_ public opinion is that it's not good enough.

# How I see Dev Tooling

I've always been interested in the effect the tools we use on the products we build.
I understand that this belief system exposes me to confirmation bias towards the effectiveness
of Dev Tools, so I'd love to hear from you if you see me hand waving too much here;

I believe the tools we use to build things have a tremendous amount
of influence on the products we end up building. Checkout <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfytHvgHybA&list=PLjhH01A4YOO3h0LwGNTf2F37L0_Gn7O4D&index=2">
Bret Victor's Talk on YouTube</a> to dig deeper into how exactly. But the main point is that
an immediate feedback loop from the tools is very valuable to the human brain.

Practically, for me it translates to the idea that good observability tools and automation are the main drivers
of innovation in tech. This should in turn generate more revenue than what you spent
on the observability and and automations, creating a positive feedback loop ♻️.

But how? Well, the gist theory is that it is easier for our constrained brains to think and explore
ideas if we can offload things are brain does into the computer. For example with observability,
consider Traces - we can't really understand what is going on if we look directly at the trace data,
but once we put it on a nice graph, we can reason about the flow very intuitively. For example

# How the industry looks at Dev Tooling

This idea has gained popularity in recent years. A lot of technical organizations started
to spend money and effort on DX and Dev Tools. There was a surge in
[evidence](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_Research_and_Assessment#Accelerate_(book)>)
about how DevOps practices can raise profits and reduce costs for any modern company.
This movement was a trigger for tech companies wanting to spend more on
"Developer Productivity Tools", "DevOps" and similar buzzwords. Makes sense.

However, if we look how it turned out in the industry, it seems like DX does not really
live up to the expectations.

<a
  title="To latest report on emerging tech"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies"
>
  <img
    alt="Gartner hype cycle for Emerging Tech 2024"

  ></img>
</a>

At the top we can see "Internal Developer Portals", which seems great! But when I look
more closely, I can't really find any other tech that focuses on the Dev Experience, maybe expect for GitOps.

Most of the emerging techs are AI related as far as I understand. It makes sense that AI
is showing up all over the hype graph - just open your favorite social network and in five minutes
I bet you'll see someone talking about AI.

But if you scroll twitter looking for someone talking about
Internal Developer Portals (IDP) or GitOps, I bet you won't see it as much.

And it's not _just_ on social. From my personal experience, executives in companies are
reluctant to spend **more** money on Dev Tools. What usually happens is that the dev tools
they buy and use don't live up to the expectations set in the literature or by the
product they bought. So companies deprioritize Dev Tools in their budget lines in favor of,
usually, some AI tech trying to solve the same underlying problem.

The thing is, I don't see this as a problem. This sentiment I hear actually aligns with
the Hype Cycle! In other words, there were **inflated expectations** towards
Dev Tools! It's just part of the hype cycle! Nothing to worry about!

# Overcoming the Trough

So up until now I hope I convinced you that Dev Tools _were_ in the Peak
of Inflated Excpetations, and are no longer there.

Now I want to look at the future. Where are we on the graph now? And, more importantly,
where are we headed on the graph?

Zooming out of the Gartner graph above, I want to remind you that Dev Tools
are much more than Portals and GitOps. I'm missing some important concepts, like:

- Internal Developer **Platform**
- Progressive Deployments
- API Docs Generation
- On Demand Dev Env
- Observability

I think there's potential here because of that. It seems to me that there's a gap
between the expectations executives have and the actual products they buy.
Dev Portals and GitOps are not sufficient to create the type of culture and
environment that the DevOps movement advocates for.

In the language set by Gartner, I think we are way down on the _Trough of Disillusionment_
because we have a lot of _Enlightenment_ to do! In other words, I see a big enough gap
between what the theory and litrature promises and what the current technology actually offers.

This makes me confident that it is only a matter of time and effort until we figure this out.

# Developer Productivity is an Iceberg

There's a lot more to Developer Productivity and tooling than what I can possible fit in this blog post.
I think the industry is only scratching the surface of what is possible and needed.

My best analogy is the famous Iceberg meme ([example](https://blog.palark.com/kubernetes-is-an-iceberg/)).
From "above water", Developer Productivity seems like a new idea with simple solutions.
Looking at the Gartener analysis, it seems like creating an IDP and working with GitOps practices
covers a lot of ground.

But once you actually dig in, there's soooo much _under_ the surface of the water!
I won't even attempt to enumarete things myself in this post. There are much better
qualified resources for that.

In fact, this week [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net/?page_id=2), a veteran
in the Continuous Devlivery space, published a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/5VpBRmmWqg0?si=KOf_vpM3BgeroWWs)
reacting to an article aimed at executives that is filled with misinformation
that goes directly against the science. He explains it better than me so do checkout his video 😉

For me, what Dave is talking about is a good positive signal that there's much more
potential to be extracted in this field. It's clear to me that the [science](https://dora.dev/) of how to build
a productive and successful software company is simply not yet understood or implemented.

# Next Steps

I think this post is a good (enough) of **_why_** I'm trying to solve problems
in this space. I think there's value here.

**_How_** to achieve this is a different topic, which I plan to write more and more about 😄

Hopefully you found value in reading this as well! If you did, stay tuned to hear more 🙌
