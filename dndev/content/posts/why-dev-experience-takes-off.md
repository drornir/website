**Developer Experience** (DX) is a new buzzword in the industry. Like any buzzword,
it's trying to give an idea a name, in hopes that this idea will spread easily in 
the industry. I'm thinking of other buzzwords like "RESTful", "Agile", "DevOps",
"Functional", "UX", "MVC", "Kubernetes"...

I'm not saying that a buzzwords are inherently bad. But they all share in common 
a simple truth about knowledge transfer between humans - the original message
gets lost on the way. It's like the hebrew game of "Broken Telephone". So I want to
write down what it means ***to me*** in hopes to get the internet to correct me.


## DX is UX, where User == Developer

DX doesn't say much. It's just the idea that "Doing UX" should be applied 
*not only* to customers, but also *internally* to your own workers.

"Doing UX" means to care about how accessible your app is for consumption by the 
people who use your software. It is worth investing in because users see UX as 
a feature they are willing to spend money on. Even without understanding **why**
good UX drives profits up, as long as they do. It is therefore usually easy to 
convince "management" to spend money on UX.

But if you try to understand **why**, and you care enough to ask your users, you'd
hear answers pointing to being more productive. Essentially, people are willing 
to spend money on better UX because better UX actually lets them **do more**.

So DX is investing in productivity in order to increase profits. At least, that's how
I think of it.

Notice I'm carefully avoiding to say "developers". I think, in its base, the idea of
DX applies to every worker in the company. But I think investing in developers is
a good starting point to understand and experiment the idea.
