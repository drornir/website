**Developer Experience** (DX) is a new buzzword in the industry. Like any buzzword,
it's trying to give an idea a name, in hopes that this idea will spread easily in 
the industry. I'm thinking of other buzzwords like "RESTful", "Agile", "DevOps",
"Functional", "UX", "MVC", "Kubernetes"...

I'm not saying that a buzzwords are inherently bad. But they all share in common 
a simple truth about knowledge transfer between humans - the original message
gets lost on the way. It's like the hebrew game of "Broken Telephone". So I want to
write down what it means ***to me*** in hopes to get the internet to correct me.

I've always been interested in the idea of using tools to push me into doing 
a better job, hopefully faster. I've always preferred a usable, clear UI than a 
powerful one. In programming, this preference showed itself in preferring
statically typed systems.

For me, any statically typed language is easier for me to use. I give the compiler
a set of _constraints_ regarding the structure of data I expect to have, and it
reads all the code I wrote to make sure I didn't violate any rule.
It's a great example of what you can achieve if you tell the computer what set
of constraints you want to impose upon yourself (or yourselves), and the type 
checker helps you verify those constraints are true for every part of your program.

The idea of 

## Tell me what you want to do, not how.

Declarative style programming is not the best approach to any problem.
Sometimes you really need to get down there and give the computer an exact recipe
on how you want things to happen.

But most of the times, we don't really want to learn *how* the API we consume
works. We just want to tell the thing what we want it to do, and give us a nice error
message if it doesn't understand us. 

I think it's evident by the rise of declarative systems in the last years.
For example, Machine Learning, Kubernetes and React are all frameworks that are
gaining a lot of users and love 
and are based on the simple idea of 

> "Tell the system what is the end goal, and the system will incrementally
  progress towards it."

While the quality or usefulness of these system might be up for debate, you have
to admit that they are objectively popular. In my opinion it's not coincidental,
and it has something to do with how are brains works.

But in this article I don't want to argue for and/or against declarative APIs.

I'm just acknowledging that it is **attractive**. I want to build on top of that,
