title: About Me
---

I'm a programmer, doing cloud and web stuff. I usually prefer to make products
for other programmers.

I've finished Uni in 2017 (I think), and I've been working at 
[Minute Media](https://minutemedia.com) since. I've had a lot of fun,
but I recently left in order see if my crazy idea about programming 
and the culture around are even feasible.

I like talking about programming, but it becomes increasingly hard to remember why
I do programming the way that I do. And I can talk *a lot* of opinions about it. 

So this site is the place for me to sit down and write about certain topics out of
context.

If you feel like reaching out, for positive or negative feedback, I'd love to here
that. The [homepage](/) has links to places you can DM me :)
